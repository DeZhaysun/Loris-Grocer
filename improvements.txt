To start off, the rough draft was lacking consistency to the menus as it was made by different people so we had to take the time on the final version
to line everything up and give off a similiar vibe

The second thing is we did not implement primary key. The program was indeed working but we realised we did not have the use of a primary key
to link the sales table to the inventory and employee

The third thing is that we did not implement ranges where the user can specify a certain range such as from blank to blank. We thought that would
be a neat option to have

The fourth thing is that we did not implement the cool green colour which we have on the menus now

The fith thing is that we didnt realize when you sign out you can never sign in because of a boolean issue we would face

The sixth thing is that viewing for sales was very hit or miss. With some things it would give you an error where with others it would not so
we ended up spending time to fix that

The seventh thing is that we would not note if a person had the same id and just allowed it. We made is so the program would not do such a thing

These are the 7 major changes between the rough and final, maybe besides adding comments but thats pretty common.
